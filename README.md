# Remapping Ctrl to both Esc and Ctrl

This ahk v2 script remaps the Ctrl key to Esc if it's pressed and released but keeps the it's functionality of being a Ctrl modifier when it's pressed with other keys.

Supports: Ctrl + mouse scroll, Ctrl + Backspace, Ctrl + Letters, Ctrl + other modifier keys etc.

This script is from the ahk forum: https://www.autohotkey.com/boards/viewtopic.php?t=113882&p=507260

Useful for vim users so you can remap CapsLock to Ctrl and Esc at the same time.
